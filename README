Important Notes:
1. By default Ansible checks /etc/ansible/hosts for the default hosts file
1.a. I recommend putting hosts in /etc/ansible/
2. By default Ansible checks /etc/ansible/vars for default vars
2.a. I did not use any default vars - this file is not required for this scenario, but you could create a file and define puppet vars there
3. The shell script installs ansible without any of the default files - if people install it differently, they may see different results
4. All of the above is subject to change without notice or commitment to quality - welcome to continuous delivery.
